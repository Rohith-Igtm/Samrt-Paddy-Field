<h1>Smart Paddy Field</h1>

**Smart Paddy Field** is a machine learning project that detects paddy leaf diseases from images using a trained deep learning model (CNN).
It uses a **FastAPI** backend where users can upload a leaf image and get instant predictions like:

* **Healthy**
* **Mild**
* **Moderate**
* **Severe**

The model is trained using real-world images and achieves over **80% accuracy**.
Built entirely from scratch — including image handling, model training, and backend integration.
